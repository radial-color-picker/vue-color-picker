# Example - With Nuxt.js

---

Example shows how to setup `vue-color-picker` with [Nuxt.js](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/). Setup process is the same as an app built with Vue CLI or Vite, but the CSS is configured globally for all pages in `next.config.ts`.

## How to use
Download the example [or clone the whole project](https://github.com/radial-color-picker/vue-color-picker.git):

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/radial-color-picker/vue-color-picker/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 vue-color-picker-master/examples/with-nuxt
cd with-nuxt
```

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development at localhost:3000
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production and launch a server
```
npm run build
npm start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/).
